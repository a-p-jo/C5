This folder, as an archive, will contain files of versions from v2 onwards. 

This is done in the case that any ciphertext encoded with previous versions needs 
to be decoded -- which would otherwise not be possible as nearly every new version has MAJOR changes in the algorithm 
and the encoding/decoding process. Hence there is NO backward compatibility AT ALL. 

Ideally, most changes to the algorithm that break backwards compatibility are made for the reason that they enhance security as
compared to the last version. Hence, it would be a futile exercise to ensure backwards compatibility with older, incredibly insecure versions.

In abject necessity of an older version, this file is here to serve you.

Do keep in mind that C5 is, at core, a shift cipher, which means that even as-is, it is only secure enough to discourage casual 
snooping and making puzzle ciphers -- not SERIOUS security. So, ideally, any older version should be thrown away and buried deep, since it 
is an extra-insecure version of an already insecure algorithm ! 

Hope you find whatever you came looking for in this archival folder.
